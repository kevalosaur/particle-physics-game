e-:
  name: electron
  symbol: e-
  mass: 0.511
  charge: -1
  decays: false
  description: >
    The electron, e-, is a component of ordinary matter, found orbiting atomic nuclei.
    A high-energy electron is called a beta ray. Electrons leave thin trails in the detector.
ep:
  name: positron
  symbol: e+
  mass: 0.511
  charge: 1
  decays: false
  description: >
    The positron, e+, is the antimatter counterpart of the electron, with equal mass but inverted charge.
    A positron will leave an electron-like trail, but curving in the opposite direction.
y:
  name: photon
  symbol: γ
  mass: 0
  charge: 0
  decays: false
  description: >
    The photon, γ, is the carrier of the electromagnetic force and a particle of light.
    Depending on energy and source they can be referred to as gamma rays or X-rays.
    Photons are neutral and thus leave no trail in the bubble chamber.
mu-:
  name: muon
  symbol: μ-
  mass: 105.658
  charge: -1
  decays: true
  meanlife: 2.197e-6
  decaymodes:
    - weight: 1
      products:
        - e-
        - vmu
        - ve_bar
  description: >
    The (negative) muon, μ-, is a so-called "heavy electron", having the same charge as the electron but being over 200 times more massive.
    They are unstable and decay into electrons and neutrinos. They leave thick trails in the detector.
mu+:
  name: positive muon
  symbol: μ+
  mass: 105.658
  charge: +1
  decays: true
  meanlife: 2.197e-6
  decaymodes:
    - weight: 1
      products:
        - ep
        - vmu_bar
        - ve
  description: >
    The antimuon or positive muon is the antimatter counterpart of the muon, having opposite charge to the electron and also being more massive.
    Like the negative muon leave thick trails in the detector.
ve:
  name: electron neutrino
  symbol: ν<sub>e</sub>
  mass: 0
  charge: 0
  decays: false
  description: >
    Neutrinos are ghostly particles that pass directly through solid matter.
    The electron neutrino is produced when an electron is absorbed or a positron is produced.
    Neutrinos do not leave trails in the detector. Their presence can be inferred from momentum they carry away.
ve_bar:
  name: electron antineutrino
  symbol: ν<sub>e</sub>
  mass: 0
  charge: 0
  decays: false
  description: >
    Neutrinos are ghostly particles that pass directly through solid matter.
    The electron antineutrino is produced when an electron is produced.
    Neutrinos do not leave trails in the detector. Their presence can be inferred from momentum they carry away.
vmu:
  name: muon neutrino
  symbol: ν<sub>μ</sub>
  mass: 0
  charge: 0
  decays: false
  description: >
    Neutrinos are ghostly particles that pass directly through solid matter.
    The muon antineutrino is produced when a positive muon decays.
    Neutrinos do not leave trails in the detector. Their presence can be inferred from momentum they carry away.
vmu_bar:
  name: muon antineutrino
  symbol: ν<sub>μ</sub>
  mass: 0
  charge: 0
  decays: false
  description: >
    Neutrinos are ghostly particles that pass directly through solid matter.
    The muon antineutrino is produced when a negative muon decays.
    Neutrinos do not leave trails in the detector. Their presence can be inferred from momentum they carry away.
