e-:
  name: electron
  symbol: e-
  mass: 0.511
  charge: -1
  decays: false
  description: >
    The electron, e-, is a component of ordinary matter, found orbiting atomic nuclei.
    A high-energy electron is called a beta ray. Electrons leave thin trails in the detector.
ep:
  name: positron
  symbol: e+
  mass: 0.511
  charge: 1
  decays: false
  description: >
    The positron, e+, is the antimatter counterpart of the electron, with equal mass but inverted charge.
    A positron will leave an electron-like trail, but curving in the opposite direction.
y:
  name: photon
  symbol: γ
  mass: 0
  charge: 0
  decays: false
  description: >
    The photon, γ, is the carrier of the electromagnetic force and a particle of light.
    Depending on energy and source they can be referred to as gamma rays or X-rays.
    Photons are neutral and thus leave no trail in the bubble chamber.
mu-:
  name: muon
  symbol: μ-
  mass: 105.658
  charge: -1
  decays: true
  meanlife: 2.197e-6
  decaymodes:
    - weight: 1
      products:
        - e-
        - vmu bar
        - ve
  description: >
    The muon, μ-, is a so-called "heavy electron", having the same charge as the electron but being over 200 times more massive.
    They are unstable and decay into electrons and neutrinos. They leave thick trails in the detector.
